# Unsupported Zenphoto former official themes

This is an archive of former official ZenphotoCMS themes. There were once officially supported and included in the relase package.

Readme files or script comments will describe their use and these plugins are also listed on our site's extensions section:

Please remember that these themes are provided for your use and education but are not actively supported and maintained by the ZenphotoCMS team. Many of these themes are quite old and may not work correctly with current ZenphotoCMS versions.

Although we don't actively support these, we welcome contributions via pull requests or even taking over development. Please read the contributor guidelines: http://www.zenphoto.org/news/general-contributor-guidelines#providing-themes-and-plugins
